# React Movie Database App

This project was created as a solution to a technical assessment, where the task was to create a full-stack application that that allows users to search for movies and view details about them. The application consists of a frontend built with React and a backend built with Node.js and Express, all using Typescript. The frontend and backend communicate using a RESTful API. 

## Running the project

To run the backend locally:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the "tmdb-api" directory.
2. Run ``npm install``
3. Run ``npm run serve``

This will run the API on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) by default.

To run the frontend locally:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the "tmdb-web" directory.
2. Run ``npm install``
3. Run ``npm start``

This will run the React application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.
